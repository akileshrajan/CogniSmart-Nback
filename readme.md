### N-Back Working Memory Task
According to psytoolkit [1,2,3], N-Back working memory task is a task where you will see a sequence
of letters. Each letter is shown for a few seconds. You need to decide if you saw the same letter 3 trials ago, that is,
this is a n=3-back task.
<p>
If you saw the same letter three trials ago, you press a button provided according to the task requirements.
For example if you saw the letters A,B,L,T,B,C. You press a button when you see the letter B a second time since it 
appeard exactly 3 turns after it first appeared. 
<p>
In our task, based on the implementation of the n-back task by PsyToolkit, the stimulti appears on the screen for 
2 seconds and a new stimuli is presented after 500 ms of each stimuli.
<p>
The game has a total of 4 rounds, two rounds of the 0-back task and two rounds of 2-back task. Two rounds of each
task were always presented together and the order of 0-back and 2-back were counterbalanced amoung subjects. 
The task has a total of 65 trials per round 16 of which are targets.
